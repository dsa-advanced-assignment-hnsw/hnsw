class HNSW:
    """
    Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) Graph Implementation.

    This class implements the HNSW algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.
    It constructs a multi-layer graph structure where the bottom layer (Layer 0) contains 
    all data points, and upper layers serve as sparse "expressways" for logarithmic 
    scaling of the search process.

    The algorithm approximates a randomized skip-list structure generalized for 
    high-dimensional nearest neighbor search.

    Attributes:
        dim (int): Dimensionality of the data vectors.
        distance (callable): The distance metric function (L2 or Cosine).
        max_elements (int): The hard limit on the capacity of the index.
        M (int): The target number of bi-directional links for each node at layers > 0.
            This parameter controls the trade-off between graph density/recall and memory/speed.
        maxM (int): Maximum number of connections allowed per node for layers > 0.
        maxM0 (int): Maximum number of connections allowed per node for layer 0.
            Layer 0 requires higher connectivity to ensure global navigability.
        m_L (float): Level generation normalization factor (1 / ln(M)).
            Used to determine the maximum layer of a new node based on an exponential distribution.
        ef_construction (int): Size of the dynamic candidate list (beam width) during index construction.
            Higher values improve graph quality (recall) at the cost of slower indexing.
        ef (int): Size of the dynamic candidate list during query time.
            Can be adjusted dynamically to trade off search speed for recall.
        graph (list[dict[int, dict]]): Adjacency list representation of the multi-layer graph.
            Structure: graph[level][node_id] -> {neighbor_id: distance}
        data (list[NDArray]): Internal storage for the vector data (row-major).
        level (list[int]): Stores the maximum layer assigned to each node index.
        cur_element_count (int): Current number of elements stored in the index.
        entry_point (int): The global entry point node ID (at the highest layer).
        max_level (int): The current maximum layer depth of the graph.
        rng (np.random.Generator): Random number generator for reproducible level assignment.
